    <p><h2>Hello. I am Rachit Rai, a Computer Science B.Tech student. I am currently living in lucknow,UP.
        I am an introvert so the whole coronavirus situation hasn't really affected me a lot. I just miss going out to try street food,
    which now I can't so yeah that sucks. I love playing computer games. Currently I am playing an awsome game called Sekiro:Shadow die twice 
which is basically a shinobi tybe rpg game. I love watching anime and playing badminton..</h2></p>
